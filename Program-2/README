Simulate  a  four  node  point-to-point  network  and  connect the  links  as  follows:                    
n0–n2,  n1–n2  and  n2–n3.  Apply  TCP  agent  between  n0 –n3  and  UDP  n1 –n3. 
Apply  relevant  applications  over  TCP  and  UDP  agents  changing  the  parameter  and 
determine the number of packets sent by TCP / UDP.
