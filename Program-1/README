Implement three nodes point–to–point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

   n0 ----- n1 ----- n2
(Source)	(Destination)

Assignment 1: Vary Bandwidth (n0-n1) = Bandwidth (n1-n2)
Assignment 2: Vary Bandwidth (n0-n1) > Bandwidth (n1-n2)
Assignemnt 3: Vary Bandwidth (n0-n1) < Bandwidth (n1-n2)
Assignment 4: Vary Delay (n0-n1) = Delay (n1-n2)
Assignment 3: Vary Delay (n0-n1) > Delay (n1-n2)
Assignemnt 4: Vary Delay (n0-n1) < Delay (n1-n2)
